# NET CONNECTOR
It's a simply shell script to connect ethernet and wireless tools.
I build this script because I started using DWM and didn't want graphical applications on my Desktop :P

### Configuration
You need to config your network interfaces before start.
The file is well documented.

### Connecting to WPA/WPA2
Create a file with your network name inside: `net` folder, following the Demo sample.

Still under development.
